# **Class 13 Reading Notes**

## **Importance of Virtualization in the Amazon EC2 Cloud**
---
### *Why is this topic important?*
- In our profession we will be working regularly with virtualization because of its versatility and security implications.

---
### **What is Virtualization?**
- "Virtualization is the creation of a virtual, rather than actual, version of something."
- Popularized by VMware 1999, introduced to cheap Intel hardware


### **Virtualization and the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model**
- The Amazon IaaS cloud service model is characterized by delivering virtualized computer infrastructure in the form of a service.
  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is essentially an IaaS service that provides virtual servers based on the Xen hypervisor

- Another critical part of the entire process of virtualization in Amazon EC2 is Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which is also a virtual appliance.
  - AMI is mainly responsible for creating on-demand virtual machines within the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

## **Things I want to know more about**
- I'd like to know more about the various other virtuaslization solutions that AWS provides, such as their technology solutions for gaming.
