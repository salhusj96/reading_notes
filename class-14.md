## **How to Remove Malware from your Windows PC**

### *Why is this topic important?*
- Malware is around every corner on the internet if you're not browsing carefully or uneducated in that aspect of the web. But occasionally, even the most careful users still end up with malware on their system. Knowing exactly how to detect, pinpoint, and remove malware is a key skillset that most users should have, especially CySec professionals like ourselves.

## **Step 1: Enter Safe Mode**
- Before anything is done, boot your Windows PC into Safe Mode.
  - Only the minimum required programs and services are loaded.
  - If any malware is set to load automatically when Windows starts, entering in this mode may prevent it from doing so.
---
## **Step 2: Delete temporary files**
- Doing this may speed up the virus scanning, free up disk space, and even get rid of some malware.
  - To use the Disk Cleanup utility included with Windows 10 just type Disk Cleanup in the search bar or after pressing the Start button and select the tool that appears named Disk Cleanup.

## **Step 3: Download malware scanners**
- BitDefender
- Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool
- Malwarebytes
- Avast
- SuperAntiSpyware
---
## **Step 4: Run a scan with your chosen malware scanner**
---
## **Step 5: Fix your web browser**
- Malware infections can damage Windows system files and other settings. 
- One common malware trait is to modify your web browser’s homepage to reinfect the PC, display advertisements, prevent browsing, and generally annoy you.
- Before launching your web browser, check your homepage and connection settings.

## **Step 6: Recover your files if Windows is corrupt**
- Backup any crucial or personal files
- Backup device drivers
- Once you have backed up everything, reinstall Windows either from the disc that came with your PC, by downloading the installation image from Microsoft, or by using your PC’s factory restore option, if it has one.

## **Step 7: Keep your PC clean**
- Password management is a must
  - Reset and change passwords after an infection
  - Somemalware will grab this information while your PC is infected
- Be sure to always run your AV program
- Consider using the free OpenDNS service to help block dangerous sites
- Consider running virus scans on the backups to confirm that they didn’t inadvertently save infections
- Keep your Firewall active
- Make sure Windows Defender is enabled and updated
- Ensure that Windows receives regular updates automatically
