# **Class 09 Reading Notes**
## **Workstation Deployment SOP**

### *Why is this topic important?*
- SOPs are a primary way to implement or enforce a policy. Policies are intended to steer an organization to achieve the mission, vision, and goals of the organization, but without SOPs, are not actionable. SOPs also encourage consistency in execution, which is critical for demonstrating compliance with or achievement of targets described in a service level agreement. 

### **The Basics**
- "A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a procedure that is specific to a company or organization that describes the activities necessary to complete a particular task."
  - Policy; Answers "Why?" Provides broad, overarching guidance.
  - SOP; Answers "What, when and why." What needs to be done, when it is done, and why it is done.
  - Work Instructions; Answers "How." Provides step-by-step directions to accomplish a particular task.
### **Challenges**
- There is no  go-to format for writing SOPs
- SOPs can become outdated very quickly without regular maintenance
  - Things to consider when writing SOPs;
    - *Readable;* Legible font sizes, numbered pages, titles, headings, etc.
    - *Consumable;* Use a template or predefined format
    - *Understandable;* Make it focused, to the point
    - *Actionable;* Must clearly and succinctly describe what is to be done
    - *Measurable;* Activities described must be specific and measurable
  - **Always have a plan for writing an SOP.**
### **Five Guiding Principles**
- Simplicity; Should augment and reinforce training, not substitute it.
- Portability; The "What, When, and Why" should not be changed, even if an underpinning tool or application is.
- Visualization; Flowcharts and diagrams help people to visualize how the SOP plays out.
- Consistency; Use a consistent format or template to make the SOP more easily consumable.
- Audience; Write SOPs for a YOUR audience, otherwise it will not work. Conduct periodic reviews of SOPs with the people who use them.

## **Things I want to know more about**
- Are there any online templates to reference when writing SOPs?
- How often does an SOP have to be modified or revised?
- What happens when an SOP contradicts itself on the job?
