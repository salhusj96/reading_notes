# **Three Major Features of Veeam**
### **VeeamZip**
- Lets you create a backup of running VMs
- Only need two things;
  - VM you want to backup
  - Location result
- Backups are deduplicated and compressed
- Results in significantly lower backup storage requirements
- Helps with updating a VM
  - Users frequently take a VeeamZIP backup before making any changes to a VM, such as before applying updates or patches.
- Helps with archiving a VM
  - Itâ€™s simple to create a deduplicated and compressed copy of a VM before removing it from your virtual infrastructure.
- Helps with copying a VM
  - VeeamZIP encapsulates VM configuration settings so you can easily transfer and run a VM in a different location.
### **Powerful and flexible restores**
- Supports several data recovery scenarios
- Restoring VM files
  - Veeam Backup Free restores VM files directly from deduplicated, compressed backups without having to extract the VM from the backup.
- Restoring an entire VM.
  - You can restore an entire VM to the same location or to a new location.
- Restoring VM disks (VMware)
  - If a VM disk becomes corrupted by an OS failure or some other cause, you can simply restore the affected VM disk and connect it to the original or recovered VM.
- Restoring guest OS files.
  - You can restore guest OS files for Windows FAT and NTFS file systems, and also ReFS with OS-level deduplication when running Windows Server 2012. 

### **Quick migration (VMware)**
- Quick Migration lets you migrate live VMs between hosts or datastores without requiring clusters, shared storage or advanced functionality that is not available in lower-level hypervisor editions. Quick Migration works well even in environments with slow or high latency connections that prevent VMware vMotion and Hyper-V Live Migration from working!
